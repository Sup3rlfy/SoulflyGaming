    Our group landed on the idea of Sisyphus following an idea finding process using brain storming and idea mapping.
    We focused on a fun and challenging player experience that we could realize within the class timeframe.
    Therefore the content is limited to 60-120 min of playtime, depending on your skill.

    The thought of the rock tormenting Sisyphus with witty and hurtful comments on Sisyphus's lack of progress made our spiteful developer hearts smile on the inside.

    Voted <strong>second place</strong> out of the seven game projects in our class.
