  <h1>Sisyphus the Game</h1>
  <p>
    Developed in collaboration with Michael Reinegger in Game Development class 2023/24 at Johannes Kepler University Linz using unity and C#. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our group landed on the idea of Sisyphus following an idea finding process using brain storming and idea mapping.
    We focused on a fun and challenging player experience that we could realize within the class timeframe.
    Therefore the content is limited to 60-120 min of playtime, depending on your skill.

  <p>
    The thought of the rock tormenting Sisyphus with witty and hurtful comments on Sisyphus's lack of progress made our spiteful developer hearts smile on the inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Voted second place out of th seven game projects in our class. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This game is a fun and challenging take on skill and perseverance.
    Now available on Steam!
